# Credit_Scoring_Id-x_partners_project

## Background
At this time, machine learning modeling will be carried out to predict whether someone is able to pay off credit or not.
We can assume ourselves as Data Scientist in a company engaged in the field of finance.

## Problem
The risk management division wants to know which prospective borrowers meet the standards for applying for credit. To reduce the risk of default and the company incurring losses.

## Goals
Create a machine learning model that can detect potential customers who meet the standards to apply and are estimated to be able to pay off the credit. So we can reduce the risk of default.

## Column Description
The data we will use is loan_data_2007_2014.csv. The data has 74 features.
